The Titanic dataset from Kaggle is a classic dataset that provides information on the passengers of the Titanic ship. The dataset contains details such as passenger age, sex
ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether they survived the sinking of the ship. In this analysis, we will perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover
relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends.

1. Data Cleaning:

Data cleaning is a crucial first step in any data analysis project. Hereâ€™s the approach to cleaning the Titanic dataset:

Handling Missing Values:

Age: Many records have missing values for the 'Age' column. We can fill these missing values using the median age of the passengers, grouped by the 'Pclass' and 'Sex' to make the imputation more accurate.
Cabin: The 'Cabin' column has many missing values. Instead of imputing, we can create a new feature 'Cabin_known' to indicate whether a cabin number is known (1) or not (0).
Embarked: The 'Embarked' column has a few missing values. Since 'Embarked' is a categorical variable with few unique values, we can fill missing values with the most common port of embarkation.
Feature Engineering:

Title Extraction: Extract titles (Mr., Mrs., Miss, etc.) from passenger names to create a new feature that may provide insights into social status and survival.
Family Size: Create a new feature 'FamilySize' by combining 'SibSp' (siblings/spouses) and 'Parch' (parents/children) to understand the impact of family size on survival.
IsAlone: A binary feature indicating whether a passenger is traveling alone (FamilySize=0) or not.
Encoding Categorical Variables:

Convert 'Sex', 'Embarked', and 'Title' into numerical format using one-hot encoding.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

EDA helps us understand the underlying patterns and relationships within the data. Key steps in the EDA process for the Titanic dataset include:

Univariate Analysis:

Survival Rate: Calculate and visualize the overall survival rate.
Distribution of Features: Visualize the distribution of age, fare, and other continuous variables using histograms and boxplots.
Bivariate Analysis:

Survival by Gender: Compare survival rates between males and females using bar plots.
Survival by Pclass: Analyze the survival rates across different passenger classes (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
Survival by Age: Create age bins and compare survival rates across different age groups.
Multivariate Analysis:

Pairwise Relationships: Use pair plots to visualize relationships between numerical features and survival.
Correlation Heatmap: Create a heatmap to show correlations between different features.
Feature Importance:

Logistic Regression Coefficients: Use logistic regression to identify the importance of different features in predicting survival.
Tree-Based Models: Use decision trees or random forests to evaluate feature importance.
3. Identifying Patterns and Trends:

Key Insights:

Women and Children First: Women and children (younger age groups) had higher survival rates.
Socioeconomic Status: Passengers in the 1st class had a significantly higher chance of survival compared to those in 2nd and 3rd classes.
Family Size: Passengers with small family sizes had better survival rates compared to those traveling alone or with very large families.
Visualizing Patterns:

Use bar plots, box plots, and scatter plots to visualize the patterns and trends identified during the analysis.
In summary, through data cleaning and EDA, we can transform raw data into meaningful insights. For the Titanic dataset, this involves handling missing values, engineering new features, and exploring relationships between different variables to understand factors that influenced passenger survival. This structured approach not only enhances the quality of the data but also provides a solid foundation for building predictive models in subsequent analyses.
